    What do you know about "Collections"?

    Collections have 3 interfaces==> 1-Lists==>a-array lists and Linked lists//LinkedLists have 3 parent classes : List, Queue and Deque
                                     2-Queues===>a- Priority queue (concrete) b-Deque (interface)
                                     3-Sets=>a- HAshSet (concrete class)
                                             b- LinkedHashSet (concrete class)
                                             c-Sorted interface
                                             d-TreeSet (concrete class under Sorted interface)

      When do we use Linked List and ArrayList? Why?
      When do we use HashSet and LinkedHashSet? why?
      when to use which one?
