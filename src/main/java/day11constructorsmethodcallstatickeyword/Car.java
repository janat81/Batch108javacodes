      When you create a class you will use it to create an object most probably, Java knows it.
      Because of that when you create a class Java puts constructor in it automatically.

    //How to create "constructor"
    //Note: Constructor name must match with the class name
    // What is the difference between "Constructors" and "Methods"
    //Note 1: Constructors do not have "return type" but methods have
    //Note 2: Constructor name must match with the class name but methods names can be any name
    //Note 3: Constructors are used to create objects but methods are used to create some actions

    //Note: If any class you want to use, is in the same package no need to Ä±mport
    //      But if the class is in the different package, you have to import it.
